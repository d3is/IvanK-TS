IvanK TypeScript Definitions
Author: Matt Greene

IvanK : http://lib.ivank.net/

This is just a very raw TypeScript definitions setup for the IvanK library for Javascript. Due to some naming conflicts,
you are required to also include the ivank-remap.js file in your HTML document.

This is considered an ALPHA release, use at your own risk!
